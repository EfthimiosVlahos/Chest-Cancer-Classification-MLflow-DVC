## Project Overview
This project is focused on leveraging machine learning for the accurate classification of chest cancer from medical imaging data. Utilizing MLflow for efficient model management and Data Version Control (DVC) for robust data version control, this project aims to streamline the process of model training, evaluation, and deployment. The project is a showcase of practical application of machine learning in healthcare and aims to contribute towards advancements in medical diagnostics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and comprises chest CT scan images, which are crucial for identifying and diagnosing chest cancer. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/chest-ctscan-images).

## MLflow and MLOps Best Practices
A significant aspect of this project is implementing MLOps best practices. This includes:

- **MLflow for Model Lifecycle Management**: Leveraging MLflow for tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and logging parameters, metrics, and output files.
- **Data Version Control (DVC)**: Using DVC to manage data and model files, ensuring reproducibility and trackability in the machine learning pipeline.
- **Standard ML Engineer Workflow**: Emphasizing the standard workflow of a Machine Learning Engineer, which involves iterative testing, data versioning, model tuning, and evaluation.

The project serves as a practical learning journey in mastering MLflow and DVC, highlighting the best practices in the field of MLOps.

## Deployment and Technologies
The final model is deployed using Docker, Flask, and AWS, demonstrating a professional approach to making machine learning models accessible and scalable. This setup highlights key skills in:

- **Docker**: Containerizing the model and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across various development and production environments.
- **Flask**: Creating a web server for model deployment, allowing easy access and interaction with the model via HTTP requests.
- **AWS**: Hosting and scaling the application on the cloud, showcasing cloud deployment skills essential for modern machine learning operations.
